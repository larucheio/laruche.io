    <p class="lh-copy">
      Our mission is to simplify our clients and collaborators' processes,
      imaging unique solutions.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-copy">
      We try to work alongside the clients toward the goal, in order to not only
      finish the project but also involve the client during the build phase.
    </p>

    <p class="lh-copy">
      We value open source works. We are enthusiastic about integrating them to
      our projects or creating some that might help someone or could receive
      the help of the community.
